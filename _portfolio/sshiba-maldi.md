## KSSHIBA tailored for MALDI-TOF data
This repository implements the paper [Automatic antibiotic resistance prediction in Klebsiella pneumoniae based on MALDI-TOF mass spectra](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463058)
where I tailored SSHIBA model to be able to learn from both MALDI-TOF and Hospital label to learn the resistance mechanisms to ESBL or CP of _K. pneumoniae_.
