## SSHIBA tailored for MALDI-TOF data
This repository implements the paper [Development and Validation of a MALDI-TOF-Based Model to Predict Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase and/or Carbapenemase-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Clinical Isolates](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463058v2)
where I tailored SSHIBA model to being able to learn from both MALDI-TOF and Hospital label to learn the resistance mechanisms to ESBL or CP of _K. pneumoniae_.
