## SSHIBA tailored for MALDI-TOF data
This repository implements the paper [Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase and Carbapenemase-Producing prediction in Klebsiella pneumoniae based on MALDI-TOF mass spectra](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463058v4.full)
where I tailored SSHIBA model to be able to learn from both MALDI-TOF and Hospital label to learn the resistance mechanisms to ESBL or CP of _K. pneumoniae_.
