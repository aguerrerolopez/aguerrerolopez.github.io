## EODConnector
I have created a function in Matlab that retreat for you stock market data from [EOD Historical Data](https://eodhistoricaldata.com) market datafeed API. Given an API token it can retrieve any historical data of any asset/stock in EOD datafeed. With that data you can build a database for learning from simple Portfolios in Matlab to huge neural networks.
