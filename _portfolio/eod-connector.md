## EODConnector
I have created a function in Matlab that retreats for you stock market data from [EOD Historical Data](https://eodhistoricaldata.com) Data market data feed API. Given an API token, it can retrieve any historical data of any asset/stock in the EOD data feed. With that data, you can build a database for learning from simple Portfolios in Matlab to huge neural networks.

Use it whenever you need it!
