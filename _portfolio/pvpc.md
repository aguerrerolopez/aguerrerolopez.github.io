## PVPC reader
I've created a script that connects to ESIOS REE API to retrieve spanish public PVPC prices daily. Now it justs does a cute heatmap of the prices by day. In the future (if time is available...) some fancy ML will be performed over this data! Contact me if any of you readers are interesting in collaborating on this project!
