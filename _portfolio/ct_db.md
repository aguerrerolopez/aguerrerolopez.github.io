## CT-SCOPE: Annotated dataset of CT SCans for the automatic semantic segmentation of the Osseous structures of the Paranasal sinusEs

Dataset of computed tomography (CT) scans of the paranasal sinuses collected from 6 distinct hospitals, using 4 different CT devices, and ensuring diverse recording conditions. The dataset includes CT axial scans from 40 subjects, 13 of which were manually annotated with a semantic segmentation of the osseous structures of the area surrounding the paranasal sinuses, while the remaining 27 subjects contain unannotated CT scans. The data was organized into raw DICOM files and was also stored as uncompressed PNG images. The dataset includes an average of 212Â±105 slices per subject, while the annotated subset contains 696 masks paired with their corresponding CT slice. To further enhance the dataset, a set of automatically delineated masks (i.e., pseudo-labels) is also included for the unannotated CT scans.
