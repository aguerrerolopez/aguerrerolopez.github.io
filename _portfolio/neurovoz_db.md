## NeuroVoz: a Castillian Spanish corpus of parkinsonian speech

The NeuroVoz dataset emerges as a pioneering resource in the field of computational linguistics and biomedical research, specifically designed to enhance the diagnosis and understanding of Parkinson's Disease (PD) through speech analysis. This dataset is distinguished as the first of its kind to be made publicly available in Castilian Spanish, addressing a critical gap in the availability of linguistic and dialectical diversity within PD research.

Compiled from a cohort of 112 participants, including 54 individuals diagnosed with PD and 58 healthy controls, the NeuroVoz dataset offers a rich compilation of speech recordings. All PD participants were recorded under medication (ON state), ensuring consistency and reliability in the speech samples collected. The dataset is meticulously curated to include a variety of speech tasksâ€”ranging from sustained vowel phonations and diadochokinetic (DDK) tests to 16 structured listen-and-repeat utterances and spontaneous monologues. The inclusion of both manually transcribed listen-and-repeat tasks and Whisper-automated transcriptions for monologues underscores our commitment to data accuracy and usability.

Encompassing 2,977 audio files, the NeuroVoz dataset provides an extensive repository, averaging 26.88 â€‰Â± 3.35 recordings per participant, making it an invaluable asset for researchers seeking to explore the nuances of PD-affected speech. The dataset's structure and composition facilitate a multifaceted analysis of speech impairments associated with PD, offering insights into phonatory, articulatory, and prosodic changes.

In contributing to the body of knowledge with the NeuroVoz dataset, we invite the scientific community to engage with this dataset, explore the specific speech characteristics of PD in Castilian Spanish speakers, and advance the field of PD diagnosis through innovative speech analysis techniques.
