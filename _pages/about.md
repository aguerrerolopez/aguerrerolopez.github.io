Who am I
------
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bioengineering and Optoelectronics Group](http://www.byo.upm.es/BYO) in [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)](https://www.upm.es). 

**Research.**  My research primarily focuses on advancing the field of Machine Learning by understanding and developing novel probabilistic models that address real-world biomedical problems. To overcome the common challenges encountered in the biomedical field, such as missing data and heterogeneous modalities, I am dedicated to learn, develop and apply heterogeneous generative models that offer more accurate and reliable predictions. I have a deep interest in the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI) and ethical AI. With the growing influence of AI technologies in our society, it is crucial to ensure transparency, trustworthiness, and ethical alignment.

**Previously.**   I obtained my Ph.D. with honors (cum laude) from UC3M (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid) in the field of __Machine Learning for Personalised Medicine__, specifically the clinical microbiology field. I am grateful for the invaluable guidance and joint supervision provided by [Dr. Pablo M. Olmos](http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/) and [Dr. Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo](https://vanessa.webs.tsc.uc3m.es) throughout my doctoral journey. During my thesis, I was affiliated with the [Gregorio Marañón Health Research Institute (IISGM)](https://www.iisgm.com), where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Dr. Belén Rodríguez-Sánchez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=W9sZbBoAAAAJ&hl=es). The experience gained during my time at IISGM has significantly shaped my research interests and provided me with valuable insights into the challenges faced by the biomedical community.
