Who am I
------
Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) pursuing research in the field of __Machine Learning for Personalised Medicine__. I am under the joint supervision of [Dr. Pablo M. Olmos](http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/) and [Dr. Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo](https://vanessa.webs.tsc.uc3m.es). I am affiliated with the [Gregorio Marañón Health Research Institute (IISGM)](https://www.iisgm.com) and work under the guidance of [Dr. Belén Rodríguez-Sánchez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=W9sZbBoAAAAJ&hl=es). 

My research endeavors are primarily centered on advancing the field of Machine Learning by developing novel probabilistic models that can be applied to real-world biomedical problems. Specifically, my work focuses on predicting antibiotic resistance mechanisms in various microorganisms using cutting-edge techniques. To tackle the common challenges faced by the biomedical community, such as missing data and heterogeneous modalities of data, we specialize in developing heterogeneous generative models that provide more accurate and reliable predictions. I am also deeply interested in the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI) and ethical AI. As AI technologies continue to shape our society, it is essential to ensure that they are transparent, trustworthy, and aligned with ethical principles. I believe that XAI can help us build more trustworthy and interpretable models, and I am committed to promoting ethical and responsible AI practices in all aspects of my work.
