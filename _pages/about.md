Who am I
------
Currently, I am embarking on an exciting new chapter in my career. I have accepted a postdoctoral researcher position at the [Bioengineering and Optoelectronics Group](http://www.byo.upm.es/BYO) in [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)](https://www.upm.es). This opportunity allows me to continue my research endeavors and contribute to the cutting-edge advancements in the field.

I am thrilled to share that I recently obtained my Ph.D. with honors (cum laude) from UC3M (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid) in the field of__Machine Learning for Personalised Medicine__, specifically the clinical microbiology field. I am grateful for the invaluable guidance and joint supervision provided by [Dr. Pablo M. Olmos](http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/) and [Dr. Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo](https://vanessa.webs.tsc.uc3m.es) throughout my doctoral journey. Previously, I was affiliated with the [Gregorio Marañón Health Research Institute (IISGM)](https://www.iisgm.com), where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Dr. Belén Rodríguez-Sánchez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=W9sZbBoAAAAJ&hl=es). The experience gained during my time at IISGM has significantly shaped my research interests and provided me with valuable insights into the challenges faced by the biomedical community.

My research primarily focuses on advancing the field of Machine Learning by understanding and developing novel probabilistic models that address real-world biomedical problems. To overcome the common challenges encountered in the biomedical field, such as missing data and heterogeneous modalities, I am dedicated to learn, develop and apply heterogeneous generative models that offer more accurate and reliable predictions.

Furthermore, I have a deep interest in the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI) and ethical AI. With the growing influence of AI technologies in our society, it is crucial to ensure transparency, trustworthiness, and ethical alignment. I firmly believe that XAI can play a vital role in building more interpretable and reliable models. Therefore, I am committed to promoting ethical and responsible AI practices across all aspects of my work.
