Who I am 
------
Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning for Personalized Medicine at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) under the supervision of [Dr. Pablo M. Olmos](http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/) and [Dr. Vanessa Gómez Verdejo](https://vanessa.webs.tsc.uc3m.es). I am also working with [Gregorio Marañón Health Research Institute (IISGM)](https://www.iisgm.com) under the supervision of [Dr. Belén Rodríguez-Sánchez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=W9sZbBoAAAAJ&hl=es). 

My work is focused on the development of probabilistic ML models and applying them to biomedical real problems such as the prediction of Antibiotic Resistance mechanisms in different microorganisms. We focus our research on heterogeneous generative models as they can deal with biomedical typical problems such as missing data and heterogeneous modalities of data.
