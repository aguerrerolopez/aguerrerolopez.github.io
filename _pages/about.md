Who am I
------
Currently, I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at the [Institute of Medical Microbiology (IMM), University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.imm.uzh.ch/de/Highlights.html), in [Prof. Dr. Adrian Egli](https://appliedmicrobiologyresearch.net/en/)'s group. From July 2026, I am a **Marie Skłodowska‑Curie Postdoctoral Fellow (MSCA PF)**.

**Research.**  My research primarily focuses on advancing the field of Machine Learning by understanding and developing novel probabilistic models that address real-world biomedical problems. To overcome the common challenges encountered in the biomedical field (missing data, multimodalities, high-dimensional data), I am dedicated to learn, develop and apply Bayesian models that offer more accurate and reliable predictions. I have a deep interest in the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI). With the growing influence of AI technologies in our society, it is crucial to ensure transparency, trustworthiness, and ethical alignment.

**Quick CV**  
{% assign peer_reviewed = site.publications | where: "category", "Peer-review Journals" %}
I published a total of {{ peer_reviewed.size }} peer-reviewed papers; more details in the publications section.
I hold a Ph.D. with honors (cum laude) from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), where I worked on **Bayesian Machine Learning applied to Clinical Microbiology** supervised by [Prof. Pablo M. Olmos](http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/) and [Prof. Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo](https://vanessa.webs.tsc.uc3m.es), with the microbiology guidance of [Dr. Belén Rodríguez-Sánchez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=W9sZbBoAAAAJ&hl=es). After that, I was a postdoc at the [Applied Signal Processing Group](https://www.gaps.ssr.upm.es) at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) on speech impairment research under [Prof. Juan I. Godino-Llorente](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fdkx_u4AAAAJ&hl=es) and [Prof. Julián D. Arias-Londoño](https://jdariasl.github.io). I am now a **postdoctoral researcher** at the [Institute of Medical Microbiology (IMM), University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.imm.uzh.ch/de/Highlights.html), in [Prof. Dr. Adrian Egli](https://appliedmicrobiologyresearch.net/en/)'s group.
